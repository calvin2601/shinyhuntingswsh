## Context

### Background Info
As you may already know, Pokemon is about collecting a variety of creatures and battling them. But there is a subsection of players who play the game around Shiny POkemon

### What is a shiny Pokemon?

Pokemon generally come in a particular colour, such as Pikachu's being yellow and only yellow...for the most part, but there is a very small chance that a Pokemon can be a different colour as so:

Normal Charizard (orange)

Shiny Charizard (black)

For some Pokemon, the alternative colour scheme may look better. If you combine that with the rarity of encountering a Shiny Pokemon, they can become highly sought after. There is even a subreddit with over 200k subscribers. ([r/ShinyPokemon](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShinyPokemon/))

As I mentioned before, they are rare. The probability is 1/4096 in current (Gen6+) games (used to be 1/8192) but there are methods to increase your odds. It is therefore very unlikely to run into one during a normal playthrough of the game and so people who want a Shiny Pokemon will typically have to Shiny Hunt, ie keep on encountering Pokemon until they get a Shiny Pokemon and this can take a very long time, where spending weeks or even years in some cases is not unheard of.

Considering the monotonous nature of Shiny Hunting, you may have lapses in concentration and run away from a Shiny Pokemon by accident) and these cases are very well-documented on the internet such as:

You can easily find other examples on youtube.

Also sometimes the colour may not differ greatly as well and so it may be hard to tell depending on which generation of game that you are playing and some visual effects may mask the difference even more. Those with eyesight problems such as colourblindness may also have trouble distinguishing the two forms.

And this is where my Python Script comes in.

## How my Python Script works on a Basic Level

The aim of this script is to provide a safety net so that you won't miss a Shiny Pokemon.

It essentially measures the time when the text box saying that you have met a wild pokemon disappears to when the text box saying that you have sent out your own pokemon to battle.
