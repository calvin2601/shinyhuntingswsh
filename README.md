## Context

### Background Info
As you may already know, Pokemon is about collecting a variety of creatures and battling them. But there is a subsection of players who play Pokemon which revolves around Shiny Pokemon.

### What is a shiny Pokemon?

Pokemon generally come in a particular colour, such as Pikachu's being yellow and only yellow...for the most part, but there is a very small chance that a Pokemon can be a different colour as so:

Shiny Charizard

For some Pokemon, the alternative colour scheme may look better. If you combine that with the rarity of encountering a Shiny Pokemon, they can become highly sought after due to the exclusivity.

As I mentioned before, they are rare. The probability is 1/4096 in current or newer games (used to be 1/8192) but there are methods to increase your odds. It is therefore very unlikely to run into one during a normal playthrough of the game and so people who want a Shiny Pokemon will have to Shiny Hunt, ie keep on encountering Pokemon until they get a Shiny Pokemon and this can be a very long time, where spending weeks or even years in some cases is not unheard of.

Considering the monotonous nature of Shiny Hunting, you may have lapses in concentration and run away from a Shiny Pokemon and these cases are very well-documented on the internet such as:

You can easily find other examples on youtube

Also sometimes the colour may not differ greatly as well and so it may be hard to tell depending on which generation of game that you are playing and whether some visual effects may mask the difference even more.
